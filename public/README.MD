# SaveNammaBengaluru

Crowdsourcing city problems like garbage disposed, pollution (in lakes), and directing these problems to NGOs who are willing to solve these problems by actually going to the designated place and cleaning our city.

## Procedure
- Take a pic on your phone and upload it to our website
- Describe the problem. You can hashtag it if necessary.
- Any NGO going through the posts in our website will reach out and help clear the issue if the problem falls under their domain
- You can also get a list of all solved problems along with their pics and NGOs supported to ensure your city problems are in fact getting solved
- People when interested in any work of any NGOs and have interest to help their surroundings also have the option to enroll themselves and join the motion along with those NGOs, the next time they have such movement.

## Problems being addressed
- **Garbage disposal** issues can be addressed by NGOs, School/College communities and also the respective gov agencies can be notified. Some NGOs working to better our city are shuddhi.org, chintan-india.org, deepalaya.org, akshayatrust.org, etc.
- **Child labourers** identified and taken care of by schooling them
- Lake pollution, notified to authorities
- Potholes in roads, leakage of water into pathways can be again addressed to gov authorities
- Illegal properties can also be notified to NGOs who can in turn direct these issues to other agencies.
- Animal Care - Orgs like PETA India, wrrcbangalore.org and many others are willing to take care of injured, homeless, street animals.

## Future Plans
We do not want this project to hit a dead end after this hackathon ends. We definitely would love to take this project further by actually reaching out to NGOs and government agencies that would love to support our project and develop upon it.

If well funded, our team could get in touch with many organizations, start up this project on a full scale, develop native Android/iOS apps to better support the platform and more.
